User To Message Relationship
We need to setup the relationship between a user and a message. A user can send many messages while a particular message was sent by a user. So, the relationship between the user and message is a one to many relationship. To define this relationship, add the code below to User model:

// app/User.php

/**
 * A user can have many messages
 *
 * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\HasMany
 */
public function messages()
{
  return $this->hasMany(Message::class);
}
Next, we need to define the inverse relationship by adding the code below to Message model:

// app/Message.php

/**
 * A message belong to a user
 *
 * @return \Illuminate\Database\Eloquent\Relations\Futurebelongs
*/
public function user()
{
  return $this->belongsTo(User::class);
}
